ok so moving on now the challenge and its going to be quite a simple one the challenges is to add a new button to the program with the text new game now the button should call a function that clears the cards from the screen it resets the players and dealers hands and then starts a new game now the easiest way to clear the contents of a frame is to destroy the frame and create a new one with the same name and in fact that's why the program has a player_card_frame and dealer_card_frame inside the card frame itself so that's it go away and create a new button with the text new game and again the functionality clear the cards from the Screen reset the player and dealers hands and then start a new game so pause the video go away and see if you can come up with a solution and when you're ready to see our version of it come back and and I'll go through that with you pause the video now.....
